# Hand-on-machine-learning
This is an experience of reading Hand-on-machine-learning book. This is about how to do data pre-processing, how to use some gerenal machine learning algorithms and using Tensorflow to build the different models.

I have forked the code and rebuild the entire program for practicing. The code in the list can be a gold standard of processing data and build familiar NN buy Tensorflow.
